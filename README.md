# Project Title

Minting and Burning of lithium token

## Description

The code defines a simple Ethereum token contract named "MyToken." It specifies the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply. It also maintains a mapping of token balances for addresses. The contract has two public functions: "mint" for creating tokens and "burn" for destroying them. These functions modify the total supply and individual balances. It's a basic example, lacking advanced features and security measures necessary for a production-ready token contract.

## Getting Started
To initiate the utilization of this contract, adhere to the outlined steps below:
### Installing

* Access the pertinent GitHub repository associated with this project.
* Duplicate the contract code.
* Launch the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using your preferred web browser.
* Generate a new file within the Remix IDE.
* Paste the replicated contract code into the newly created file.
* Save the file with the ".sol" extension.
### Executing program

* Conduct a comprehensive compilation of the contract within the Remix IDE.
* Deploy the contract to the designated Ethereum blockchain.
* Begin the seamless execution of minting and burning token functionalities, tailored to meet your specific requirements.



## Help

Remember to save the file with .sol extension
